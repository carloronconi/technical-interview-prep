# Technical interview prep
Collection of [useful examples](./src/main/java/examples) and [actual interview questions](./src/main/java/interviews) I encountered. Each package is a standalone example/question documented with either a `README.md` or javadoc. Each example/question can be run either by itself or by running its tests.
